# Cloud Security & Compliance Portfolio

This repository demonstrates hands-on experience implementing and validating
cloud security controls aligned with NIST 800-171 and CMMC requirements.

Due to NDA and private client environments, no proprietary code, tenant details,
or production configurations are included. All materials are sanitized and focus
on security methodology, risk mitigation, validation steps, and audit-ready
evidence documentation.

## What This Repository Demonstrates
- Cloud security control implementation methodology
- Validation and verification approaches
- Evidence documentation for compliance and audits
- Security reasoning and risk mitigation strategies

## Technologies & Frameworks
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Microsoft Intune
- Azure AD / Entra ID
- Microsoft Sentinel
- NIST 800-171
- CMMC

This portfolio is intended for recruiters and hiring managers to understand how
I approach real-world cloud security and compliance work.
